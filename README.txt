1. Introduction

The Oracle Database Documentation(https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/index.html)
and other resources use these sample schemas to demonstrate the capabilities of
Oracle Database(https://www.oracle.com/database/) and the SQL and PL/SQL languages.
You can download and install these schemas in your database environments to learn
about Oracle Database functionality or try the examples in the documentation.
These schemas are provided for free.

The following schemas are included:

- HR: Human Resources
- CO: Customer Orders
- SH: Sales History
- OE: Order Entry (archived)
- PM: Product Media (archived)
- BI: Business Intelligence (archived)

Archived schemas

Archived schemas are provided for reference for examples in the documentation
but are no longer actively maintained.

2. Installing the Sample Schemas

    1. Go to the latest (or appropriate) release of the sample schemas
       (https://github.com/oracle-samples/db-sample-schemas/releases)
       and download the "Source code (zip)" file.
    2. Extract the downloaded .zip file.
    3. Inside the sample schemas main directory, navigate to the
       sample schema directory that you want to install and run
       the "<schema_name>_install.sql" script.
       (For more information about installing a schema, see the
	   "README.md" file in the schema directory.)
    4. Review the installation verification at the end of the installation
       or in the generated installation log file.

Example

To install the "HR" schema, complete the following steps:

1. "cd" into the "human_resources" folder.
2. Connect to the target database with a privileged user via SQLcl or SQL*Plus.
3. Run the "hr_install.sql" script and provide inputs for the prompts.

cd human_resources
sql <system>@<connect_string>
@hr_install.sql

3. Uninstalling the Sample Schemas

    1. Navigate to the sample schema folder that you want to uninstall
       and run the "<schema_name>_uninstall.sql" script.
       (For more information about uninstalling a schema, see the
	   "README.md" file in the schema directory.)
    2. Check the output for any errors during the uninstallation process.
